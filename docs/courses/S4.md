# S4&5 Multidisciplinary Computer Science

::: info

Head to the [S4 repository](https://github.com/WildDrone/S4) (private repo, access restricted to WildDrone members) and follow instructions there.

::: 

## Objectives
To provide interdisciplinary education for multiple PhDs with different scientific backgrounds, we will make use of two dedicated eLearning courses on programming and data science (S4) and applied machine learning for computer vision purposes (S5). The courses will be taught during the first six months of the PhD program and will enable targeted education to teach undeveloped skills (e.g., programming and data science method for ecologists and engineers).

* **ECTS:** 3, 45 hours of work
* **Lead:** [Prof. Dr. Benjamin Risse, WWU](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics.cvmls/people/risse.shtml)

## Intended Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

1. Set up and use a Python programming environment, either online or locally.
2. Use scientific computing packages such as NumPy and SciPy.
3. Use deep learning approaches for computer vision applications based on TensorFlow and/or PyTorch.

This course provides an introduction to Python programming, scientific computing, and machine learning. We will cover relevant python packages such as NumPy and SciPy and we will also introduce deep learning approaches for computer vision applications based on TensorFlow and/or PyTorch. We will include theory and programming exercises.

## Assessment
* **Submission:** Jupyter Notebook, graded pass/fail.
* **Deadline:** TBC
